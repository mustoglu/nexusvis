Foliant Publications began its journey in March 2018 under the name "Selen". After adding 27 works to our publishing world, it proceeded with a name change to "Foliant".

While contributing to the development of our literature and writers with local authors, Foliant Publications also aims to introduce the beauties of different cultures through translated works to its readers.

It has initiated efforts to produce works guiding every age group in fields such as education, popular science, preschool, children's and young adult literature, history, health, family, and literature, among others. In conducting these efforts, it strives to maintain quality publishing both in terms of materials used and the content of the texts.
