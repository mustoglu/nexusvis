Nito Kitap was founded in December 2017 by educator and storyteller Nurten Ceceli Alkan, with the primary goal of publishing original children's fairy tales and works aimed at improving family communication.

Named after the abbreviation of "From Grandmother to Grandchildren," our publishing house NITO focuses on fairy tale compilations, personal development, and communication books.

Nito Kitap continues to publish striking and original works not only with its written content but also with its visuals.
