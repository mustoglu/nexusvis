The journey of Vadi Publications began in the 1990s. A group of young individuals in Ankara believed they had words to say about the spirit of the time, and they were striving to chart a course in pursuit of truth.

In addition to voicing the sensitivities of the era, new realms of thought and discussion needed to be established. These thoughts gave birth to the idea of a publishing house, and Vadi Publications blossomed like a lily.
