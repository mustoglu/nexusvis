“I share the principles I’ve created by combining
what I’ve learned with my experiences with various professional groups, mostly psychologists,
sociologists, and neurologists. These principles are
verifi ed together with them, and I use them in my
consultations and coaching sessions. As I reach
a certain maturity and prove to myself that these
principles work in practice, I incorporate them into
the book. In this book, I will share the principles I
have created with you, along with their counterparts in professional life, family life, and social life.”
“You will read about an educator’s experiences based on years, along with real stories. While
reading, don’t forget to smile, but don’t rush for
anything... Because ‘The Hasty Fly Falls into the
Milk.’”
