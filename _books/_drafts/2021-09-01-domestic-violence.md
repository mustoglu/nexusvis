In the daily news cycle, there is a grim routine:
femicide. In the fi rst half of 2014 alone, there were
around 70 femicides reported in the media. The
vast majority of these women were killed by their
spouses, while some were murdered by their fathers, brothers, or even their own children. Among
the reasons, mental breakdowns and notions of
honor stand out.
Government institutions, local administrations,
and civil society organizations are working on a
wide range of initiatives to combat violence against
women and children, from enacting new laws to
increasing the number of women’s shelters. But
are these efforts suffi cient? According to the news,
it seems not.
Professor Dr. Aliye Mavili, who is involved in
many national projects aimed at protecting and
supporting children and families, delves deeply into
the factors that lead to women remaining in violent environments in this book. She also provides
crucial recommendations for social workers who
provide counseling services to women in this field.
