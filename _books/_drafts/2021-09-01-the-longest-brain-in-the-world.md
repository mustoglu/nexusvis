Dr. Serkan Karaismailoğlu’s unique narrative
meets readers in “The Loneliest Brain.” The author
addresses young people, parents, educators, and
all teenagers who actually live in the envy of popular culture, as well as the adults around them, fi rst
as a scientist and then as a writer, with his characteristic storytelling style that we are familiar with.
If you have no concern about the path that leads
to a youth where the age of smoking and alcohol
use has plummeted, high school students can
easily access the drugs they desire at school, the
current education system is turning our organic-brained young people into artifi cial intelligence,
and students taking exams use prescription drugs
to increase their scores, then never touch this
book. The path we have been leading our children on for years serves no purpose other than
turning them into unhappy and ruthless adults. In
this case, it is time to ask ourselves this question:
if the end of this one-way path is a cliff, is there
any option other than leading that youth astray?
My dear young friend, we haven’t met yet, but I
know very well what kind of loneliness you’ve been
trapped in. The darkness around you deepens day
by day. But don’t be afraid. The power to eliminate
this darkness is hidden deep within your brain. You
just aren’t aware of it. The only truth promised to
you by the book you are holding right now is this.
I will do everything in my power to help you reach
that inner strength, and when we reach the ultimate end, you will understand why I trusted you so
much. If you’re ready, take a deep breath and let’s
begin.
