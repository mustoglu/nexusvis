“What does fi nance mean to non-fi nanciers?”
This book, which was written in response to friends
who said, was prepared by taking into account
your current and potential colleagues who try not to
teach you what they know throughout your business life or in your potential business life, because
they are afraid of being understood that they do
not know something very important. Don’t let them
become indispensable...
A unique starter book for anyone who wants to
learn fi nance. You will see that this concept, which
we may encounter at any time in business life, is a
subject that can be easily learned by anyone who
is interested, contrary to popular belief.
