Brand is a harmony of concepts and values.
However, although frequently expressing the
importance of all these is valuable in itself, it is not
suffi cient. However, structures nourished by culture
and memory can carry the existing structure into
the future by developing their own unique combination of values and concepts, and the pattern of the
process of carrying the resulting structure into the
future can only be constructed in a healthy way;
by manifesting the projection of yesterday and the
future in today...
Brand-Culture-Memory, especially the brand’s
relationship with history and culture; From different perspectives such as the context of economic
history, sociology, examples in our country and
abroad, refl ections in the world of culture and
arts, media brand relationship, personal branding
processes, resilience and brand relationship, the
concept of brand from past to present, especially
brands about the past-present and future, or those
who aspire to produce brands. It offers important
tips for those who are. With this content, the aim
of the book is to offer the reader different perspectives outside of classical branding discourses, rather than addressing all aspects of the “brand issue”,
which deepens and expands day by day. Zafer
Toprak, Besim F. Dellaloğlu, Kamil Fırat, Görgün
Taner, Funda Tekelioğlu, Özalp Birol and Hakan
Güldağ contributed their writings to the book compiled by author Âsûde Alkaylı.
