Digital transformation, the term given to the
change we are witnessing and part of, has been a
topic of discussion and debate for quite some time.
Equally discussed and often overlooked is the role
of employees in this transformation. Individuals, as
“employees,” should consider:
- What should they do?
- How should they prepare themselves for the
transformation?
- Which competencies should they acquire, and
how should they acquire them?
“The Transformation of White Collar to Digital Collar” aims to provide solutions for the dimension of
the employee that we believe has been lacking. To
achieve this goal, the book provides concrete and
practical information to readers, enabling them to
create a roadmap for themselves.
