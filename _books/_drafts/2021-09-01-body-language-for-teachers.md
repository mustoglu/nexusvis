A team consisting of a physicist, chemist, geologist, and anthropologist is conducting research in
the fi eld. Suddenly, it starts raining, and they take
shelter in a nearby house. The homeowner leaves
the room to offer something to the guests. The
attention of the team turns to the stove in the room.
They notice that the stove is one meter above the
ground, resting on stacked stones underneath.
They begin to discuss why the stove is set up this
way, each proposing complex theories. Shortly
after, the homeowner returns to the room, and they
ask him why the stove is elevated. The man helplessly gestures with his hands open, replying, “We
didn’t have enough pipes...”
Sometimes truths are like this: simple, clear, and
evident. However, over time, when a wall of theories is built between us and the truth, we lose the
correct perspective. It’s like not being able to see
the forest for the trees... We bring our knowledge,
experience, and bodies to the classroom. While
the fi rst two may not be immediately apparent,
our bodies are always there. The book shows
the ways to use our bodies correctly, notice our
possible mistakes, and understand the messages
conveyed by the bodies of those around us, which
are more functional than smart boards, projectors,
and visuals. It aims to focus on the living, evident,
and meaningful rather than long, practical theories
trapped in books. In simpler terms, it draws attention to “insuffi cient pipes” without burdening you.
