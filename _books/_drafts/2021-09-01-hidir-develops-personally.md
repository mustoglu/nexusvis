Ahmet Şerif İzgören, through the experiences of
Hıdır, ridicules books published under the title of
“personal development.” He humorously explains
how these books distance people from their true
selves and lead to disappointment. Criticizing the
mindset based on individual success and competition, he also highlights the failures of so-called
personal development experts in their own lives:
“Most of the guys who write books for you are not
as happy as you are, rest assured. Those who
keep talking about positive energy might not even
smile.”
