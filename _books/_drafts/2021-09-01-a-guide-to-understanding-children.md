The “Guide to Understanding Children,” written
by Family and Marriage Counselor Özgün Kızıldağ,
serves as a guide not only for parents but also for
anyone involved in communicating with children
from infancy to adolescence and for anyone curious about a child’s developmental journey.
Presenting situations from real life that every
family, teacher, psychologist, and counselor may
encounter, the “Guide to Understanding Children”
explains how to behave when faced with similar
situations and offers practical suggestions for
seemingly diffi cult situations. Providing reassuring
approaches to your confusing observations and
fi ndings about your child, it contains highly benefi cial information for us parents who are growing
alongside our children.
