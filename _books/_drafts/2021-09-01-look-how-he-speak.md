Little naughty things are never idle in their mother’s womb. Even before they are born, they begin
to collect information about the language they will
speak. They prefer listening to the language they
were born into over other languages; they can distinguish melodic differences after a few days, and
they can form long, extremely complex sentences
when they are not even fi ve years old.
So, how do they achieve this without developing
abstract thinking skills?
What strategies do they use when learning the
rules of their native language?
How does the language development of children
who have to learn two or more languages as soon
as they are born develop? Do smart children talk
earlier?
How does one move from kintu to muntu?
Is the language that twins speak to each other
dangerous? What should you do if your child says
“shit juice”? Here is Look How He Speaks, where
you can fi nd answers to your questions in every
line! It invites both parents and those who are
curious about the language acquisition process of
babies to witness the miraculous process.
