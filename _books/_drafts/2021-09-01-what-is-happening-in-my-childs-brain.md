If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if we
could see inside our child’s brain, then this book
is perfect for you. Written by the author in light of
scientifi c facts, in a language so simple that we can
apply it to our daily lives. With examples, photographs, and tables throughout, the book serves as
a guide for all parents and those aspiring to have
children.
In your hands, you hold our magical glasses. In
this book, I wanted to say, ‘There is a way to look
into our children’s brains,’ by compiling the results
of many studies on children and the brain. I also
made sure not to neglect adding developmental
recommendations to the end of each chapter,”
begins Associate Professor Saniye Bencik Kangal
in her new book.
