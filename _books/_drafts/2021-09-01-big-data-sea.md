Do you want to learn about the concept of big
data, which has such an impact on our lives? Then
this book is for you! You will fi nd how the big data
we produce at every point of our lives is analyzed
and managed, along with examples and its role in
the future. You will also get answers to the questions of what is data expertise and who is a data
expert, one of the most important professions of
the future.
Big data is everywhere our eyes see. The data
we produce is a river, and the sea it fl ows through
is big data. It is present in the plane we board, in
the bank we visit, in the car we drive, in the research of our genes and in the treatment of diseases, in short, in every step we take and in every
pulse we beat. Data is produced every second of
our lives. How can we manage such dense data
and obtain meaningful information for ourselves?
