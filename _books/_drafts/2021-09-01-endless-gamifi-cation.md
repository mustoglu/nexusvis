Infinite Gamifi cation is a playbook that will teach
many managers how to do some things in their
organizations in the future, not with hierarchy, but
with volunteering, fun and internal rewards. In this
book, author Toby Beresford describes many of
his experiences, such as the setup of games to
be set up within the company, the types of leadership rankings, the advancement of those who
join the game late, the calculation of points such
as sales and information, and the mathematics of
level-by-level logic going from easy to diffi cult.
Gamfed Türkiye Founder Ercan Altuğ Yılmaz,
“As we play, we move away from depression, become more authentic, productive and happy.
How serious we are in our workplaces, don’t you
think it’s time to break this game? He introduces
the book to the reader with these sentences.
Elma Publishing House offers its new book to its
readers by saying “stay with the game, stay in the
game” in your workplaces.
