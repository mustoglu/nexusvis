In the fi rst edition of his book titled “Here Comes
Crisis!” Dr. Hakan Özerol explained that history did
not err, and he demonstrated that many interim
processes similar to the processes of crisis have
occurred repeatedly throughout history. The 2008
Lehman Crisis also proved once again that crises
are part of a cycle. Therefore, in our new edition
enriched with new chapters discussing the events
that occurred after the 2008 Lehman Crisis, we
have changed the title of our book to “Waiting for
the Crisis.”
Every crisis will eventually end, only to be followed by a new one. Yes, the crisis will come suddenly, like before, but it will also give many signals
before it arrives. As long as you know where to
look. “Waiting for the Crisis” identifi es the places to
look from the pages of history for you.
