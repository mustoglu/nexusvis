For years, I felt helpless. I was rejected. Doors
were slammed in my face. I was penniless. I battled depression.
I hit rock bottom.
Now, I lead a life I enjoy in Silicon Valley, pursuing a career I fi nd meaningful, and the brand I’ve
established in Turkey reaches millions.
I know we all have times when we feel “at the bottom” or will have them. But there is light at the end
of the tunnel. Believe me. Let’s walk this tunnel
together. Let’s reach that light together...
You will read about Emre Şimdi’s career journey
in his book, where he describes the challenges he
faced and how he started over when he thought
“this is it.”
