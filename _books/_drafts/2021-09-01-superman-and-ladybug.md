I read Superman and Ladybug during a time
when I felt I was being unfairly treated in my
career. Like the “ladybugs” in the book, I wanted
to be someone who fi ghts until the end and holds
onto life tightly; I realized once again the importance of what I have, even my very breath, and
that I need to appreciate their value. I started thinking that without compromising my personal virtues,
I need to make more effort every day to increase
my knowledge, culture, and experiences and to
offer them in service to those in need. Most importantly, in every moment of diffi culty, I now read the
story of a heroic “ladybug” from the Superman and
Ladybug book that I now carry in my bag.
