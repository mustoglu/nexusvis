When a person loves themselves, it’s almost
impossible for them not to be a lovable person.
By loving oneself, I’m not referring to a narcissistic dimension of self-love, of course! What I’m trying to convey is a state of being more content with
oneself, knowing one’s potential, and moving forward in life along that potential, rather than blaming
others or seeking approval. It’s about self-refl ection
and drawing from oneself for guidance. Such individuals generally love themselves and are closer
to happiness. Why? Because knowing their potential allows them to realize themselves in life, they
achieve spiritual fulfi llment, they know what they
can and cannot do; they don’t need external validation, their self-confi dence is solid. People who love
themselves, because they know how to love, fi nd it
easy to love others and don’t struggle to show their
love.
