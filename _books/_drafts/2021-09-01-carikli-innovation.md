…We will innovate. But we will do this in accordance with both our company and the geography
we are in. So, do not forget that the product I am
talking about in the story I will tell is ultimately
a sandal! Yes, you know; I’m talking about the
three-penny sandals that are hung on the walls as
decorations or worn by our relatives in the village.
This is such a sandal that at the time this book
was written, it was sold for 195 US dollars per pair
in 12 countries, especially the USA. It resurrects
a 600-year-old craft that is about to disappear in
Turkey and creates new job opportunities for young
people who do not have any profession. This is an
entrepreneurship story founded from scratch and it
includes different types of innovations.
And this story shows us that innovation can be
achieved even without sandals, and even innovation in Turkey is a bit like sandals!
