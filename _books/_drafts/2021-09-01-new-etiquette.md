In ancient times, it was considered an important
etiquette rule for people to leave their spears outside when entering a tent. Handshakes, which conveyed the message that they would not harm each
other in those times, are still used today, although
they may not fully express this meaning anymore.
Etiquette rules, which have undergone changes
over time and circumstances, have also found their
place in this fi eld with the development of technology. Etiquette rules, reshaped by concepts such
as image, body language, and empathy, especially
with the advent of cell phones and the internet,
have evolved from being considered as behaviors
practiced only by a certain segment of society to
being indispensable for people of our era, in their
new form.
“New Etiquette Rules” presents this change in
its most basic outlines, from addressing to invitations, from social interactions to attire, from visits to
phone conversations.
