Many of the entrepreneurial stories in this book,
written by Mehmet Auf and published by Elma Publishing, are both humorous and instructive. While
reading about the adventures of failure on the road
to success, you will both laugh a lot and witness
stories that could happen to anyone.
As Mehmet Auf also suggests, sometimes quickly recognizing what’s going wrong and giving up
without harm can provide an advantage for moving
forward. Other times, stories of individuals who
have gone through similar situations can serve as
examples to prevent us from giving up too quickly.
