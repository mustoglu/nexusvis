This book does not offer you the answer to the
question “how to become famous”. On the contrary, it tells the story of failures, misfortunes, disappointments and rebellions. And most importantly,
how realizing it creates a great miracle... Because
every word in this book was written with sincerity
and belief.
We all have negative stories as well as good
ones in our lives. And most of the time we cannot
evaluate those stories in the present moment.
Actor Hakan Bilgin, who loves being on stage and
touching people’s lives, wrote the book “Those
Who Caught My Difference” for this purpose. So
that we can realize it earlier, enjoy life and not be
upset with the good days we will have.
