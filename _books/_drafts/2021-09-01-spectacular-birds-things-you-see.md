Over the years, Hürriyet Kaya, who penned down
her experiences, dreams, disappointments, and
memories, brought them all together in her book
“Görgülü Kuşlar Gördüğün İşler” (The Experienced
Birds Witnessed Your Deeds).
“Experienced birds witnessed your deeds”... This
phrase holds a special place in my life. I used to
hear it a lot from my father. As a mother, a teacher,
and a human being, it always guided me in forming
my life philosophy.
There’s always something to learn from each
other in this life. Sometimes you learn a life lesson
from a child, sometimes from life itself... These
lessons grow you at every age, they mature you.
So, as I occasionally went back to my childhood,
my youth, and sometimes lived in the moment, the
phrase “experienced birds witnessed your deeds”
was always by my side... That’s why I wanted to
share my experiences, my lived experiences. Like
the story of the starfi sh, perhaps I could add a
pinch of salt to someone’s life.
