Everyone loves their mother dearly, but Tatloş is
different. As the youth say, she is a brand. She is
a dervish, a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother, an aunt, a sister, a friend, a neighbor,
someone consulted for advice, honest, trustworthy,
unique...
The human memory is astonishing. Sometimes it
brings forth the deepest memories, while at other times, it forgets the closest ones. That’s why
Bengül İzgören, who listens to her mother’s words,
took up her pen and began writing, saying, “Let
it stay not just in memory, but in writing.” You will
read about her mother, the people she touched,
Demirci, and many others. Witnessing the sweet
moments of the past between the lines, Pamuk
Nine Gülten Anne awaits you with the warmth of a
neighborly mother.
