This book was written as a step in my 14 years of
service to the coaching profession and to express
my gratitude for the thousands of benefi ts it has
provided. And with the hope that maybe a drop or
an ocean of water will sprinkle the confusion created by the degeneration of personal development...
Unlike many development tools, the leverage point
of the coaching system is “the uniqueness of the
individual.” This is exactly the reason for the letter
“n” at the end of the book name. As the answers
to the questions in the applications are written, as
many different books will emerge as there are people reading them; Thus, the author of each coaching book will certainly be the reader himself.
