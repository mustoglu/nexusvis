The author Mehmet Auf begins by saying, “This
is a story of transformation,” and dives into the
story of Hakan, who tries to adapt to the changing
work rules during the pandemic days. In the book,
there are experiences, concerns, and realizations
of a sales representative who questions himself
the most, refl ecting on what he has experienced
both in his professional and personal life and his
relationships with others. The author narrates to us
the universal consequences of universal disasters,
human reactions, and adaptation to new conditions
by basing the story on similar examples that we all
experience.
