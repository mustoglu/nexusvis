The author Bora Özkent addresses the readers
with the slogan “Haddini Aş” (Transcend Your Limits) in his new book. From the fi rst page to the last,
the book is built upon this idea.
They have never consented to live the life stories
designed by others and placed in front of them.
They have never blindly adhered to rules and
dogmas dictated by others.
And they have never been trapped within the limits drawn for them, never allowed others to dictate
their limits, and never hesitated to do their best to
exceed those limits.
Because the fi rst step on the path to extraordinary success is already this:
Desiring to transcend your limits above all else.
The slogan “Haddini Aş” is based on these observations.
