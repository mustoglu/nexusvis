Selling, persuading, and effectively presenting;
in short, no matter how we express it, sales is
everyone’s common profession. Sales, knowing
the techniques expected from sciences like psychology, sociology, and mathematics, and molding
them with emotions, is a job, responsibility, and
profession where one can strive to be “better.” The
fl awless combination of confi dence from knowledge and feelings nurtured in the heart creates a
“superb ethical salesperson.”
We read stories of real experiences in sales
from the pens of master educators who have been
teaching this subject for many years. Authors Fulya
Ertekin Alkan and Erdinç Kural convey through
lived stories in their book “Teaching Sales Stories”
how a good sales and sales expert should be.
