Özden Aslan is indeed a profi cient author in the
fi eld of management books. There are two main
reasons for this: Firstly, he doesn’t try to directly
teach lessons in his works. The reader extracts
the lesson themselves, which is a great opportunity. Secondly, Özden Aslan is a good leader and a
highly experienced HR manager. Therefore, what
he narrates is always practical and real. This book
is not only for managers but also for everyone in
the business world to learn from. The only downside of the book is that the author is Turkish. If the
book were published under the name “Dolores
Steward,” it would certainly be read more widely,
rest assured.
