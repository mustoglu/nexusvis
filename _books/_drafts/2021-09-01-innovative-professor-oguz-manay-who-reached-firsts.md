Professor Dr. Oğuz Manas pioneered many fi rsts
in the fi eld of computer science and the internet in
Turkey, from the establishment of university and
institutional computer centers to the fi rst electronic
commerce project. In this river conversation, you
can fi nd memories and experiences of Manas, who
has positively infl uenced the lives of many generations, not only in academic projects but also in
various subjects such as health, sports, family life,
and personal life.
According to his students, Oğuz Hoca is like a
prophet: 40 years ago, he predicted that the United States would elect a black president, and long
before the emergence of the World Wide Web, he
foresaw that shopping would even be done online
in the 2000s.
