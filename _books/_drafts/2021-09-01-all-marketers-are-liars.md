In today’s business life, where competition is
quite intense, it can be said that classical marketing methods and tactics are bankrupt. In such a
world, tactics that were once considered attractive,
such as promoting or advertising, offering promotions or gifts, do not have the same impact on
conscious consumers as they used to. According
to Godin, the most effective tactic of today’s marketer is to fi nd a story that suits the identity of the
product they want to sell, to construct and surround
this story very well, to fi nd the appropriate consumer audience and to tell the story in a language they
can understand. If the message in the story reaches the right target audience on the right frequency,
the individuals of that audience will believe in this
story wholeheartedly and will literally adopt this
story. In fact, not only will they adopt it, they will
also pass this story on to their friends and acquaintances.
Whether you are interested in the marketing
profession or a consumer, you will fi nd a piece of
yourself and your experiences in the marketing
process on every page of this book, which approaches marketing from a different dimension and
in a humorous way, and you will not be able to stop
yourself from smiling sweetly.
While reading this book, which can be read in
one breath with great pleasure from beginning to
end, let’s not pass without making a reminder. I
wonder what kind of story is Godin telling you, the
readers, while marketing this book? And how much
will you believe this story?
