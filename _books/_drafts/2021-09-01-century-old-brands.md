Branding requires originality... In the transition
period from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic,
and even before, we have established prestigious
brands. Especially in Istanbul and other cities,
there were businesses operating under occupation,
participating in foreign fairs with limited resources, continuing production during times of supply
shortages and scarcity, participating in the War of
Independence and returning to their businesses
afterward, keeping their shops open during revolutions, persevering through every crisis, providing
solutions, and never giving up. These brands carry
the knowledge and experience of these lands, they
are century-old brands.
