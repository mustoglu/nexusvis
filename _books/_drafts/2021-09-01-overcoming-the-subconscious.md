This book contains the stories of eleven people
who came to psychotherapy and are suffering
today due to the effects of their childhood experiences. Among many patients, I specifi cally chose
these eleven people. Because they all actually
have lives like you and me. They can continue their
jobs, family lives, social lives and relationships. He
does not have severe psychiatric disorders. Except
for a few, people experience problems that we
are used to seeing in ourselves or in our relatives
every day.
Hilal Doymuş goes deep into the subconscious in
the stories she tells based on her own experiences. It provides examples of how problems arising
from childhood experiences can affect an adult’s
life.
