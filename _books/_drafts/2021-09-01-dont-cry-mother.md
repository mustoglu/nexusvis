While writing this book, I embarked on a journey
of my own; I poured my experiences, emotions,
and my unwavering belief in never giving up into it.
Then, I thought about my profession, the disabled
individuals and their families around me, the incidents I encountered during this process; I pondered over the prejudices of society towards the
disabled, and many negative perspectives. Most of
all, I thought about the grieving, weeping mothers
and fathers, and the smiling eyes of the children...
In this book, Şule Özcan narrates her own experiences. Not only does she share what she has
lived through, but she also says to families with
disabled children, “It all begins with acceptance
fi rst...” Then, she sequentially explains what should
be done, how one should act... She shows the
reader the way to overcome obstacles...
It integrates with the title of the book and says
“Don’t Cry, Mom” on each page...
