The widespread adoption of modern technology
and the internet has presented humankind with
an incredible opportunity. “Scientifi c knowledge,”
which has been accessible only to certain institutions and privileged individuals for decades, is
now within reach of anyone who seeks it. However,
while this equality in accessing information is a
tremendous opportunity for humanity, it also brings
with it a signifi cant danger. The same technology
that enables access to information also allows for
the dissemination of fraud and false information,
which has existed since the dawn of humanity, to
reach a wide audience.
This book aims to connect with individuals who
seek solutions through questions rather than getting stuck in ready-made answer patterns and who
endeavor to understand the essence rather than
easily believing in the superfi cial.
