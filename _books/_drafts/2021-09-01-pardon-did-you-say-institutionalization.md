Everyone has a lot to say about institutionalization... I’ve written about these in detail within
the pages of the book. The most common and
pleasant-sounding defi nition is often stated as,
“An institutionalized company is one that operates
based on rules, managed within a system, not
dependent on individuals. Management, stakeholders, suppliers, and employees are all integral
parts of this system and are required to adhere to
these rules.” Is the concept of “system and rules”
suffi cient to establish institutionalization? Shouldn’t
even the largest companies, considered to be the
biggest and ranked in the top fi ve hundred annually
in various sources, review their institutionalization?
Is institutionalization only a problem for organizations classifi ed as SMEs (Small and Medium-sized
Enterprises)?
