Dear trusted partner; trust has been a vital lifeline
for humankind since the very beginning, enabling
us to take steps and move forward. Especially in
recent years, we are going through a period where
trust has greatly diminished and perhaps is on the
verge of disappearing in some places. That’s why
we feel like we are living in an atmosphere of doubt
and fear down to our core. The reason behind the
creation of “Two-Faced Trust Partner” is to breathe
with trust, to keep our minds from being trapped
in spirals of fear, and to free our hearts from the
darkness of doubt.
In this book, you will encounter a wealth of information, experiences, scientifi c research, and stories
about trust. Designed as two-faced, on one side of
the book, you will get to know the bright, positive side
of trust, and on the other side, you will explore the
dark side that increases the possibilities of abuse.
While there is never a message stating “Trust is
sometimes not a good thing,” you will come across
many ideas and pieces of information about the
negative consequences of excessive trust and how
to deal with them. If you are someone who says, “I
trusted too much and ended up defeated, experiencing disappointments. I won’t trust again, I can’t
trust,” then I hope you read this book thoroughly.
Perhaps in doing so, you will initiate action to inject
trust back into your own life, our society, and our
world, and you will be the one nourishing the light.
Remember, dear trusted partner; developing trust,
increasing reliability is always possible.
