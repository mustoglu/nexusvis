Teaching; a magnifi cent profession where each
day is different from the other, with no repetitions,
and a long story. I am writing to remind new teachers of experiences and exemplary incidents, so
they stay in mind. Perhaps somewhere, similar
things happen, and prior learnings prove useful.
We believe that sharing this journey will make it
more beautiful, and ours will be the footnotes of the
opening chapter of this long story. Müjdat Ataman,
who says that teaching is about “teaching and
learning,” shares recommendations from his experiences in his book “112 Notes on Teaching” with
us.
