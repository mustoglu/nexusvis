The author said, “I paid attention to three points
when presenting the book to the reader: It was
more fl uent than a classical business book, it contained more practical information than theoretical
information, it included human emotions as well
as logical discourses such as this should be done,
that should be done...” He begins by telling the
story and meets the reader with what an employee
who aims to be successful in business life should
do, through the fi lter of his experiences lived or
observed in many different sectors and companies.
