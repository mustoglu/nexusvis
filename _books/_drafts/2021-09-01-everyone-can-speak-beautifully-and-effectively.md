Through eloquent and effective speech, we
achieve success and respect in business life, and
happiness and love in personal life. If we want to
enchant others with our voice and words, what we
need is not just talent. Everyone can speak effectively and beautifully, as long as we desire, learn,
and work for it...
In this book, we will discover the colors of our
voice on the journey we embark on, enrich our
vocabulary, and craft beautiful sentences. We will
also learn to broaden our impact by mastering
body language. Ultimately, we will construct a new
identity within ourselves.
