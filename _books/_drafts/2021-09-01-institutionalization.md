In my opinion, institutionalization and trying to be
sustainable by becoming institutionalized are very
misunderstood. Being corporate; It is not about
drawing the organizational chart, fi lling it in, writing
job descriptions, writing procedures, writing rules,
writing penalties, writing this, writing that. Nor does
it mean tying our hands and drowning ourselves in
documentation that may never be read.
Our author İdil Türkmenoğlu’s latest book, CORPORATION[MA], although it is basically based
around “culture”, it generally consists of three
parts: Changing business life, needs and the need
for changing human resources accordingly, culture
and fi nally a conscious workplace culture. “Democracy in the Workplace” as his choice.
