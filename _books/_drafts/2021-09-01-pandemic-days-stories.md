An epidemic that started to spread at the end
of 2019 and affected the whole world in 2020 and
went down in history... Corona, quarantine, social
isolation, social distance, which settled fi rst in our
brains and then in our language... What sits in our
hearts is untimely losses... Lives lost.
Who can explain pain better than those who suffer
it?
We started everything by asking this question.
Beyond numbers, research, medical data
We wanted to make an “Emotion Archive” and
shed light on the future, so that the experiences of
this period would never be forgotten.
For this reason, we listened to “people” fi rst.
Thus, the book Epidemic Days Stories emerged
from nearly two hundred diaries and stories sent to
us from Turkey and different countries of the world.
Now we present it to you on behalf of Elma Publishing House and everyone who contributed to the
book.
