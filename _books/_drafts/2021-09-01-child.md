Whether youâ€™re a scholar or a tyrant, your fi rst
role in the world was that of a child. First, we were
the children of our parents, then we became the
children of this society. Society is like a fi nely
woven, colorful tapestry. Each child is a tiny dot in
that tapestry! Even though we may be small dots,
our place and color in the tapestry are determined,
as well as our harmony and compatibility with
other dots. We are all connected to each other with
threads of different colors, just like in a tapestry.
The colors within us breathe life into the whole.
The fading of that color within us affects the beauty and harmony of the whole picture. This book
was written so that all children may hear beautiful
words, be treated rightly, and be molded with the
dough of love. It was written for myself as a child,
for you, for our children whom we brought into this
world, and for everyone who works with children or
struggles with themselves.
