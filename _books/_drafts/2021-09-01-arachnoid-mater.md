Hello, reader. I don’t know who you are or what
date it is, but if you’re reading these lines, it means
our paths have somehow crossed. Let me warn
you from the start. Although what is written here
may seem like a small part of an event, there is
actually a complex story with deep roots behind it.
I’ve tried to write down everything I can remember.
Because I am the end. If something happens to
me, these memories living in my neurons will be
buried in the ground. That’s why I wanted to write
everything down. I buried my past and memories
alive within the pages so they wouldn’t die. I hope
you understand me and what I’ve experienced.
Welcome to my home and my body.
