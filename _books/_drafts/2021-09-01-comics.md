If you think the author meant to say ‘cartoon
science’ or ‘cartoon fi lm,’ let me tell you right away,
no, you read it correctly. CARTOONSCIENCE.
In this book, you won’t see alarming judgments
like ‘Beware, manga and anime are full of violence
and sexuality, never bring them into your home,’
or dismissive statements like ‘Oh come on, they’re
just cartoon characters, what harm could they do?’
We’ll simply delve into the world of cartoons and
get to know them better. With the infl uence of my
background as a physiologist, we’ll also take a
look at the underlying physiological mechanisms of
vision, hearing, and learning science.
