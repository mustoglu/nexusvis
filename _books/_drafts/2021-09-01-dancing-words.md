“Dancing Words” narrates the educational journey of a student from their own perspective. It
delves into the challenges, the resulting despair,
and the burdensome problems that young individuals face, which may seem too heavy for their
shoulders to bear. Moreover, this uphill battle is
compounded by the differences caused by dyslexia, ADHD, and synesthesia. Eighteen-year-old
