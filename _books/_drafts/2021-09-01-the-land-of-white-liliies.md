The Land of White Lilies is a place where Suomi,
as it is known in the international community, and
the Finnish people, in the political and cultural
spiral of Sweden and Russia, escaped from a
tragic underdevelopment under the leadership of
intellectuals, soldiers, clergy and entrepreneurs,
despite the harsh natural and climatic conditions.
The rediscovery of the national language, culture
and consciousness, in short, a total national enlightenment and development, is revealed through
a series of narratives and stories in which realities
and dreams are combined.
This book, which Elma Publishing House offers to
its readers, is not just about translating the text in
Arabic letters and adapting its language to today’s
Turkish. Proper names, historical events and facts
mentioned in the work were researched, and brief
information compiled about them was shown in
footnotes. In this published book, some facts about
the work will be revealed to the reader for the fi rst
time.
