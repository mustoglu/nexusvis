You’ll read the secrets of sales from the perspective of a professional salesperson who has presented sales pitches to over two hundred thousand
people both domestically and internationally. Barış
Kılıçarslan, a salesperson who pushes all boundaries with his different methods and approaches to
customers, turning the known upside down...
The author says,
The best salespeople in the world are those who
can sell the outcome, who can draw a picture in
their customer’s mind of “what will change in your
life if you buy from me” and make them feel it.
To draw this picture, you need methods that appeal to both logic and emotions, as well as instinctual decision-making. Because people instinctively
start the buying decision, make the decision emotionally, and justify it logically.
And if you want to make sales, you must know
the codes for all three.
That’s why this book contains twelve sales codes
that can persuade by triggering instincts, logic, and
emotions.
