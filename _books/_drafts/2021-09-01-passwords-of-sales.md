You will read the secrets of sales from the pen
of a professional salesman who has made sales
presentations to more than two hundred thousand
people at home and abroad. Barış Kılıçarslan is a
salesman who pushes all boundaries and reverses
what is known with the different methods he uses
and his approach to the customer...
The author says,
The best salespeople in the world are those who
can sell the result, that is, those who can draw a
picture of “what will change in your life if you buy
from me” in the customer’s mind and make them
feel in this picture.
To draw this picture, you need both logic, emotions and instinctive decision-making methods.
Because people start the purchasing decision
instinctively, make the decision emotionally, and
explain it logically.
And if you want to be able to sell, you must know
the passwords of all three very well.
That’s why this book contains twelve sales codes
that can persuade by activating both instincts, logic
and emotions.
