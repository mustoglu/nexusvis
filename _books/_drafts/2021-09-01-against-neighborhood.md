Knowing is praised. It is believed that knowledge is the wealth of the soul. The superiority of
those who know over those who do not know is
accepted. “It is seen that science elevates humanity,” says the thinker. Correct information expands
and enriches our perspective. Insisting on ideas
that are squeezed into narrow patterns and show
from a single window is the biggest obstacle to
development and change. If I think so today, the
biggest share in this belongs to the young people
who have once again clearly shown me that looking at the world with the help of the light that leaks
through solid patterns does not bring anything to a
person.
It is a reality accepted by everyone that alienation
and hostility do not benefi t any party. For this reason, we can make our lives easier by understanding the “neighbourhood” well and creating mutual
empathy.
