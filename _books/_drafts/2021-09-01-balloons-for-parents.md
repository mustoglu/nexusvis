Dr. Nevzat Adil begins his book by stating, “I
wanted to share the knowledge I have gained so
far with young parents to help them raise ‘happy
and free’ children.”
...If you approach your children with conscious attitudes and behaviors, you can make life easier for
both yourself and your children. Here, I do not want
to convey a message like “Forget everything, just
focus on your child,” which is neither realistic nor
true. Striving to be perfect parents can bring about
other problems. Remember, parents also need
special time for themselves and for each other.
This will positively affect the happiness of the family and consequently the development of the child.
In this book, you will fi nd the experiences, observations, and recommendations of an educator.
Each one includes real-life examples and the
author’s comments on the subject, which will guide
you.
