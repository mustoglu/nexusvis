Our years as students were built on a foundation
of listening, in a passive structure. No one cared
about how we learned, whether we were interested
in what we learned, or whether we participated in
class.
Perhaps the language lessons, which could have
been the most enjoyable, continued for years in a
repetitive manner. The text on the specifi ed page in
Turkish textbooks would open, sequential readings
would begin, questions related to the text would be
answered, and speaking and writing skills would
generally remain in the background. Years passed,
but there was no change in the way language lessons were taught.
This book is not an alternative Turkish textbook.
It is a work that can interject between text-based
lessons, containing activity examples in which students can actively participate in class and offering
suggestions for writing. It was written in the hope
that a different voice would bring a different perspective to a lesson.
