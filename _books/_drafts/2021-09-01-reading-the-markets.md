In fi nancial markets, when everything is going
well, everyone makes money. If the stock market
has risen by 30,000 points, it means almost everyone has made money. When things are stable
and money is being made, investors have full
confi dence in themselves. They believe they know
everything and understand everything. They quickly see themselves as “talented.” Because they
believe they are successful and talented, they don’t
feel the need to consult anyone.
But what should be done when things are uncertain and the direction of the markets is unclear?
That’s when an investor needs a “guide captain.”
An experienced guide who knows how to read the
markets and, more importantly, teaches them how
to read the markets... Since understanding the
markets is diffi cult, the guide should not overwhelm
them with mathematics and statistics.
This little book in your hands was written with this
claim in mind. It is a guide that does not contain
mathematics and statistics, aiming to explain all
Market Prediction Methods.
