Business life and trade are changing completely. The concept of time and space disappears. An
economy is being formed independent of time, of
countries that work 24/7. While the change has
come to this, can the current organizational structures, management systems and company management continue in the same way? Can marketing laws, marketing theories and understandings

world with the old approach?
In its new book, Elma Publishing House tells the
reader about the changing conditions in workplaces. Author Bilal Temizer opposes those who ignore
the truth by sticking to the past, without leaving
their comfort zone, with the examples and explanations he gives. “The King is naked,” he says to

Our new book is here for the proliferation of F.i.t
