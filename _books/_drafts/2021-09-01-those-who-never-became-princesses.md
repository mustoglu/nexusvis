I believe that the life and business stories of our
incredibly successful role model female industrialists, featured in my book, will inspire all readers.
Surely, every reader gaining inspiration from even
a single sentence in these stories and implementing it in their lives will undoubtedly bring infi nite
happiness to everyone featured in the book. Many
businesswomen who read my book and are new
to the fi eld will fi nd inspiration from the success
stories of our accomplished female industrialists,
benefi t from the experiences of previous generations, and perhaps, a beautiful network will form
among us. I embarked on this journey with this intention entirely. I extend separate thanks to all the
valuable female industrialists who contributed to
my book, shed light on the future, made invaluable
contributions with all their sincerity, and with whom
we intersect at the point where we can never be
princesses in the end.
