Erden Eruç achieved the feat of circumnavigating the globe solely using human power, after 5
years and 11 days. He is the fi rst and only person
in history to accomplish this feat solely through his
own strength. He holds the record for the fastest
“circumnavigation by human power” and is the fi rst
person to row across three separate oceans. Eruç
broke the Guinness World Record for the longest
time spent alone at sea in a rowboat, with 312
days spent in the Pacifi c Ocean. He also holds the
record for the longest distance covered by human
power across the Atlantic Ocean without stopping.
As of the end of 2016, Eruç had spent 934 days of
his life rowing across oceans, making him the most
experienced ocean rower alive.
We learn about Erden Eruç’s incredible journey
and experiences throughout the circumnavigation
through questions directed by Çağrı Özpideciler
and Eruç’s own accounts.
