Creating and establishing a brand is one of the
most important challenges a company has to face.
Companies invest signifi cant effort and money to
differentiate their products or services and to make
a lasting impression on people’s minds. The only
way to protect our brand is to register it. Protecting
our cherished brand from external threats is not as
diffi cult as it may seem. With a few important tips,
it is possible to protect both our patent and our
brand.
This book contains information about trademarks,
patents, and all industrial rights that you won’t fi nd
anywhere else. You’ll get answers to questions
like, “Should I apply for a patent or a utility model
for my product?” and “How can I prevent my industrial designs from being imitated?” It serves as
a guide that explains all the topics that managers
and marketing department employees are curious
about.
